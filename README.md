# Temperature_calculation
Implement into the given code template a program that prints the given temperature measurement both as Celsius and Fahrenheit degrees.

Conversions between the scales go as follows. A measurement in Celsius is converted to Fahrenheit by first multiplying the measurement with 1.8 and then adding 32 to the resulting product. The opposite conversion uses opposite calculations. A measurement in Fahrenheit is first subtracted by 32 and then the resulting difference is divided with 1,8.

The program first asks a temperature and then prints as shown in the following examples:

Enter a temperature: 0
0 degrees Celsius is 32 degrees Fahrenheit
0 degrees Fahrenheit is -17.7778 degrees Celsius
